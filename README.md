My Matlab program, Amazon UAV Delivery Solution, calculates a circle's center point and radius formed by three randomly placed UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) within a 15x15 mile area. The program uses matrix math to determine the circle's center and radius, ensuring the UAVs are not collinear by checking the determinant of a matrix. If the determinant is zero, new UAV coordinates are generated. Once a valid center is found, the program calculates the time it takes for the UAVs to return to the center, assuming a speed of 0.5 miles per minute. The results, including the UAV coordinates, center location, radius, and return time, are displayed to the user. The program also plots the UAVs, the center point, and the circle on a graph, with axes labeled and a title added for clarity. The script includes a custom function to calculate the determinant of a 2x2 matrix.
